# Caddx NetworX Security Panel  (Indigo Plugin)

## Overview

It is a comprehensive protocol implementation of Caddx NX-584 RS-232 Gateway Interface Protocol (April 2000) spec.

This should work with the Caddx NX-584 RS-232 Gateway Interface for the Caddx NX-4, NX-6 and NX-8 but I do not have the hardware to test this. It has only been tested with NX-8e.
